# Minesweeper

The Minesweeper board is a graphical grid of squares. A certain number of squares, chosen randomly, 
conceal dangerous mines. Play proceeds when a user left-clicks on a square. If that square hides a mine, 
the game is over and the player loses. If not, then stepping on the square reveals the number of mines hidden by squares adjacent
to that square – a number between 0 and 8. A player can right-click on a square that has not
yet been stepped on to mark it as being potentially mined, and remove the mark with another
right-click. Numbers represent squares that have been clicked, ’F’s are
places the player has placed a flag, and ’ ’s are squares that have not yet been clicked.
